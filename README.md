#   FPS Meter

##  Description
The idea was inspired by Krunker.io (a website-based first-person shooter). In the game mechanic, the higher the browser's frame rate, the faster the player moves while doing the bunny hop trick. With this tool, I can directly know whether the browser's frame rate limit has been lifted or not.

## To lift the frame rate limit
> Right click Chrome logo
> Go to the `Properties`
> Put the follow string to the very end of `destination`: --args --disable-frame-rate-limit

## To test the frame rate
Remember to close all windows of Chrome first before testing.
